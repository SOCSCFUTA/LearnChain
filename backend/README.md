# Overview

This backend powers a certificate verification system. It enables organizations to securely issue certificates for students, ensuring authenticity and preventing forgery. Organizations can obtain API keys to manage certificates, including issuing, modifying, revoking, and verifying them through API endpoints.

## Main features:
- API key management for organizations
- Certificate issuance and modification
- Certificate revocation
- Certificate verification


## How to use API Documentation

<summary>üìö <strong>Quickstart</strong> - Basic Usage</summary>

1. **Open the `openapi.yaml` file in an online viewer**  
    Visit [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) or a similar website.

2. **Upload or paste the `openapi.yaml` content**  
    Use the website interface to load your `openapi.yaml` file.

3. **Browse the API documentation**  
    The website will render interactive API docs. Explore available endpoints, parameters, request/response formats, and authentication requirements directly in your browser.
