# Backend Overview

This backend powers a certificate verification system. It enables organizations to securely issue certificates for students, ensuring authenticity and preventing forgery. Organizations can obtain API keys to manage certificates, including issuing, modifying, revoking, and verifying them through API endpoints.

### Main features:
- API key management for organizations
- Certificate issuance and modification
- Certificate revocation
- Certificate verification
